        <p>Playing Piano</p></section>
    <section>
        <p> MY favourite hobby is to play piano.Whenever I have free time i spend my tme playing piano.am 10yrs old and i am studying in 5th standard.My school name is Howard Public School.The fact that music from piano soothes the soul is known to us all but it also acts as a stress buster.Since piano requires using both your hands doing different things for playing it, you might not be able to deal with it at first. Gradually, the art of split concentration becomes an integral part.By maintaining the correct posture of hands and using the proper hand position while playing the piano makes your arms stronger.The aural awareness that is developed by playing the piano makes it easier for you to understand the sound patterns of foreign languages.Learning to play the piano broadens the vocabulary and verbal sequencing skills of students.The Human Growth Hormones or Hgh in the human body has been found to have an altered growth in children who play the piano.Children who take piano lessons get continuous feedbacks and constructive criticisms from their teachers. This prepares them to accept criticism in a positive way, building them into individuals with stronger and better mental health. </p>
